## My process

### Built with

-   [Astro](https://astro.build) - Static Site Generator
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - CSS Framework
-   [Piccalilli CSS Reset](https://piccalil.li/blog/a-modern-css-reset/) - Modern CSS reset by Andy Bell

### What I learned

Learned how to bootstrap a project with Astro and stack it with Tailwind CSS framework. I added custom colors to Tailwind theme for the first time by modifying the tailwind.config file. See below:

```js
theme: {
		colors: {
			'primary-soft-blue': 'hsl(215, 51%, 70%)',
			'primary-cyan': 'hsl(178, 100%, 50%)',
			'dark-blue-main': 'hsl(217, 54%, 11%)',
			'dark-blue-card': 'hsl(216, 50%, 16%)',
			'dark-blue-line': 'hsl(215, 32%, 27%)',
		},
	},
```

### Continued development

Although Astro was overkill for this project, I enjoyed using it and will continue to do so. It is a lightweight static site generator that will allow me to use React framework, but not require it.
